# AtomAlchemy
AtomAlchemy is a Python project utilizing the Tkinter library to create an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for calculating the mole per gram of chemical elements or compounds. Tkinter provides the backbone for building a user-friendly interface, allowing users to input chemical formulas or element symbols effortlessly. By harnessing the power of Tkinter, AtomAlchemy enhances the user experience, offering a visually appealing and interactive platform for conducting chemical calculations. Whether for educational purposes, laboratory work, or research endeavors, AtomAlchemy's Tkinter-based interface simplifies the process of determining mole per gram values, empowering users to make informed decisions in their chemical analyses and experiments.
